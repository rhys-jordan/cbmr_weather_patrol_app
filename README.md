### How to Run:
run main.py

### Introduction:
The Crested Butte Mountain Resort Weather Application is a collaborative project between the Western Computer Science Capstone students Nathaniel Rengo, Rhys Jordan, Joshua Clyncke, and the Crested Butte Ski Patrol under the direction of Krista Hildebrandt. This project will result in an online application that allows CBMR Ski Patrol to better control their collection, storage, and use of data regarding snow and weather on the Resort. 


### Purpose and objectives:
The purpose of this project is to help expedite the Crested Butte Ski Patrol weather tracking and record keeping. The goal is to reduce the time and energy spent by CBMR entering their weather data. CBMR does not use the data currently stored in their excel sheet, so another objective of this project is to produce visuals and summaries of existing data for later use.
